Test IO exploratory tests, created on the Jira platform or the Test IO platform, can be seamlessly viewed through the Jira Cloud Plugin. This integration allows users to access and monitor tests with various statuses, including **Customer Finalized**, **Waiting** and **Running** directly from Jira.

Users can view comprehensive details of these tests, which include:

- **Start and End Date**: The time frame during which the test is scheduled to run.
- **Test IO Product and Section**: The specific product and section associated with the test.
- **Included Features**: A list of features being tested.
- **Devices and Environment**: Information about the devices and environments used for the tests.
- **Test Goal**: The primary objective or aim of the test.
- **Out of Scope**: Clarifies aspects that are explicitly not covered or tested as part of the current test session.
- **Requirements**: Any specific requirements or criteria needed for the test.

This detailed view enables tracking the progress and status of exploratory tests efficiently. By having all relevant information in one place, teams can better coordinate their efforts, ensuring that all aspects of the test are covered.

Additionally, the page includes a convenient **filtering option to sort tests by their current status**. This feature enables users to quickly focus on tests that meet their specific status criteria.
