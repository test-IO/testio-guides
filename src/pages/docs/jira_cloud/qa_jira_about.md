QA Service for Jira connects your Jira instance to Test IOâ€™s network of professional testers. These testers evaluate your software in real-world conditions on real devices, providing detailed bug reports with screencasts and step-by-step reproduction instructions.

Testers can execute your test cases, perform exploratory tests, and verify bugs. You have the flexibility to test entire applications or specific sections, and you can specify the devices or browsers for testing.

**Key Features**:

- **Seamless Integration**: Connect Test IO to your Jira instance in minutes.
- **Flexible Testing Options**: Test whole apps or sections, and choose the devices or browsers you want.
- **Professional Testers**: Leverage a network of professional testers to ensure thorough testing.
- **Comprehensive Bug Reports**: Receive detailed bug reports, including description, screencasts, and steps to reproduce, directly in Jira.
- **Two-Way Integration**: Enjoy robust integration and synchronization between Jira and Test IO, enabling you to manage and monitor your workflows without leaving the Jira interface.

If you are a Test IO customer, this app provides direct access to Test IO tests and tester reports within Jira. If you are not a Test IO customer, you can still install the app, but a Test IO subscription will be required to utilize its features. We offer a free test on one of your projects so you can experience our testing capabilities and see how seamlessly it integrates with your Jira workflow.
