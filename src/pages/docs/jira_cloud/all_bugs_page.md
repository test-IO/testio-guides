The Jira Cloud plugin provides comprehensive access to Test IO bugs, even after they have been accepted or rejected. The plugin's **“All Bugs” section** offers a unified view that includes:

- **Open Bugs**: Bugs that are currently under review or awaiting action.
- **Accepted Bugs**: Bugs that have been validated and accepted, and have associated Jira tickets created for them.
- **Rejected Bugs**: Bugs that have been reviewed and dismissed with any of the rejection reasons.
- **Bugs with Pending Status**: Bugs that are awaiting confirmation or further information after Send request action.

First, **apply a search** to view results based on your specified criteria. You can search for bugs on the "All Bugs" page by their **Title**, **ID** and **Test Cycle ID**.

The advanced search functionality streamlines bug management and tracking, offering quick access to relevant information and enhancing efficiency.
