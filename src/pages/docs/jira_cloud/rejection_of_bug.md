description: Learn how to reject the Test IO Bug.
---

Once you have reviewed the received Test IO bug with an open status, you can begin the triaging process. If you decide not to validate the bug and choose not to export it to your Jira, you can **reject the bug** by following these steps:

1. **Select Bug**: From the Bug Triage section, choose a specific open Test IO bug from the list.
2. **Reject Bug**: In the expanded bug details on the right side, click the “Reject” button.
3. **Select Reason**: Choose an appropriate rejection reason from the available list that best fits your case.
4. **Add Comment**: Optionally, add a comment for more details.

5. **Confirm Rejection**: Click the “Reject” button.

The bug is rejected in both Jira Plugin and Test IO, **removed from the Bug Triage/ Open bugs list**, and later **can be found in the Jira Plugin's "All Bugs" list** with the rejection reason included in the comments.
