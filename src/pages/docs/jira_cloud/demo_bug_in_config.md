After configuring and saving the changes in the Issue Type and Fields Mapping tab, the **"Create demo Bug"** action button becomes available. This feature allows you to test your mapping configurations **by exporting a sample bug to Jira** using the defined mapping rules.

**Key Points**:

1. **Availability**:  
   The **"Create demo Bug"** button becomes enabled only after all changes on the Issue Type and Fields Mapping tab are saved.
2. **Disabled State**:  
   If there are unsaved changes, the **"Create demo Bug"** button is disabled.
3. **Creating a demo Bug**:  
   Once you click **"Create demo Bug"** button a demo bug is successfully created in Jira, and an info message saying **“Demo bug is created”** appears on the page. This message includes **a link to the last exported Demo bug** for easy access and review.

The "Create demo Bug" feature ensures that your mapping configurations are correctly set up before applying them to actual Test IO bugs.
