**Steps to Copy and Share a Bug Link**:

1. **Select Bug**:

   - Navigate to the Test IO Bugs -> Bug Triage section.
   - Select a specific open Test IO bug from the list.

2. **Copy Bug Link**:

   - Click the link icon next to the selected bug title in the expanded bug details on the right side.
