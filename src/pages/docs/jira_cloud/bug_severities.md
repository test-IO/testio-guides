Different test types include different severity levels in the test scope. To ensure our views on severity are aligned, here’s how we classify bugs and issues:

**Functional Bugs**

- **Critical**: Prevents a function of the app or website, potentially causing loss of income (e.g., an app crash or inability to log in).
- **High**: Serious impact on user experience but doesn’t prevent the function of the app or website.
- **Low**: Minimal impact on user experience.

**Non-Functional Bugs**

- **Usability**: Suggested improvements to existing features and functions that would make the product easier and more intuitive to use.
- **Visual**: The user can accomplish a task, but the interface looks wrong, typically due to responsive design, CSS, HTML, or layout framework problems.
- **Content**: Bugs related to missing data, images, or broken links.

**Note**: Non-functional bugs are classified as low-severity bugs by definition.
