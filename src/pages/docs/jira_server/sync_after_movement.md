title: Synchronization with Test IO after Jira issue movement
description: Learn how to ensure proper synchronization with Test IO after moving a Jira issue from one project to another.
---

When moving a Jira issue from one project to another, it's important to ensure proper synchronization with Test IO. Letâ€™s explore the steps and considerations for handling issue movements and their impact on Test IO configurations.

**Case Scenarios**

**Case \#1: New Project Has a Suitable Existing Configuration**

The new project has an existing configuration that can be applied to the issue being moved.

**Dropdown Options and Actions**:
{% list type="dash" %}

- **Apply new configuration**:Select this option to update the issue with the new project's configuration, ensuring it syncs correctly with Test IO.
- **Keep old configuration**: Choose this to retain the existing configuration, even if it's not related to the new project, maintaining the current sync settings.

{% /list %}

**Case \#2: New Project Has a Suitable Existing Configuration, No Current Configuration for the Issue**

When the new project has an existing configuration, but the issue does not have a current configuration:

**Dropdown Options and Actions**:
{% list type="dash" %}

- **Apply new configuration**: This option applies the new project's configuration to the issue, enabling proper Test IO synchronization.
- **Keep disabled synchronization**: Choose this to leave the issue without synchronization settings, effectively disabling Test IO sync for this issue.

{% /list %}

**Case \#3: New Project Lacks Suitable Configuration, Existing Configuration for the Issue**

When the new project does not have a suitable configuration, but the issue has an existing configuration:

**Dropdown Options and Actions**:
{% list type="dash" %}

- **Keep configuration**: Retain the current configuration even though it doesn't match the new project, maintaining existing Test IO sync settings.
- **Disable synchronization**: Opt to disable synchronization with Test IO for this issue, effectively stopping any Test IO updates.

{% /list %}

**Case \#4: New Project Lacks Suitable Configuration, No Current Configuration for the Issue**

Action:
{% list type="dash" %}

- Since there is no configuration to keep or apply, the dropdown will not appear. Create a new configuration for the new project to enable synchronization.

{% /list %}

**No Warning Cases**
{% list type="dash" %}

- **Case \#5**: Changing the issue type within the same project does not affect Test IO synchronization.

- **Case \#6**: Moving a Jira issue to a project that has the same configuration as the issue retains synchronization without any warnings.

{% /list %}

Steps to Move a Jira Issue and Manage Test IO Synchronization:

1. **Select the Issue to Move**:
   {% list type="dash" %}

   - Navigate to the issue you want to move.
   - Choose the new project to move the issue to.

   {% /list %}

2. **Review Configuration Messages**:
   {% list type="dash" %}

   - Based on the scenarios described above, review the displayed info message.
   - Select the appropriate option from the dropdown if applicable.

   {% /list %}

3. **Apply Changes**:
   {% list type="dash" %}

   - Confirm the movement and apply the selected configuration option.

   {% /list %}

4. **Create New Configuration if Needed**:
   {% list type="dash" %}

   - If the new project lacks a suitable configuration, create a new configuration for Test IO synchronization before moving the issue.

   {% /list %}

By following these steps, you can ensure that Jira issues are properly synchronized with Test IO when moved between projects, maintaining consistency and efficiency in your workflow.
